# Shamrock

An absolutely free vector image of a trefoil shamrock, artisanally crafted by an Ulsterman. A wonderfully full-leafed, traditional beauty of an Irish shamrock, if I say so myself.

## Why?

There are very few decent, free images of shamrock out there. What is available is a shambles: poor quality, awkwardly Celtic, weedy, degraded, bitmapped, four-leafed clovers. Inevitably, this leads well-intentioned people to slap shite clovers on their Saint Patrick’s Day odds and sods. It just isn’t right.

## Free?

Aye. It’s licensed under the MIT license which means: you don’t have to pay anyone and you can use it for whatever you want. You can’t claim you made it, which seems fair because you didn’t. You can’t blame me for any woes you bring upon yourself by using it.
